# Exporting files

In logAxe application user can drag and drop 
* Select a list of logs and export the corresponding files.
* Select the files from the manage file form/tab/view and export the same.

The exported files are compressed into one single zip file.

Tip: This feature is very useful in the scenario when we can load a lot of files from a log folder filter all the errors and export those files to be sent/analyzed later.
